# Sonos Entrance Announcer for Android

Plays your unique soundtrack (hosted as MP3 on a web accessible server) when your Android phone connects to a network with SONOS speaker present.

We suspend the current SONOS queue and directly play the MP3 URL to your soundtrack as specified in the app. This is a great, nerdy way to make your arrival known among your colleagues or roommates.

Work In Progress:
* Still figuring out the simple service discovery protocol usage to detect SONOS speakers.
